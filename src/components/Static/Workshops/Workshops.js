        The ball workshops are designed for learning the dances on the ball program and are not intended 
        to be an introduction to English country dance. Each of these workshops will focus on different 
        ball dances and styling tips. Familiarity with English figures and geography will be assumed at 
        the workshops.

        The afternoon workshop will include a review of most of the Ball dances and styling suggestions for 
        greater dancing pleasure. We will spend time on those dances that are a bit more challenging, so 
        that in the evening more time can be spent dancing rather than learning. We strongly advise 
        attendance at the workshop - plus it is fun!
